# The Employee Insights Hub 
## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To better understand the dataset and prepare it for further analysis, an exploratory data analysis was conducted.

###  Objectives of the EDA
The main goals of this step were to:
- Visualize the data distribution
- Identify trends and patterns
- Detect outliers
- Understand correlations and relationships between variables

Through this analysis, we gained valuable insights that guided the data preprocessing and modeling phases.
### 1) Gender Distribution

Bar chart showing the gender distribution in the company.

==>The figure shows that the proportion of men and women in our workforce is relatively balanced, with a slight male predominance.

![Bar chart showing the gender distribution](screenshots/gender_distribution.png)
### 2) Education Level Distribution

Bar chart illustrating the distribution of employeesâ€™ education levels.

==> The figure shows that most of our employees have a Masterâ€™s degree, followed by a significant number of individuals with Bachelorâ€™s degrees, and then by those holding Engineer diplomas.

### 3) Employee Distribution by Job Grade

Bar chart illustrating the distribution of employees by job grade within the company.

It is evident that the most common grades are "Financial" and "Manager", closely followed by "Communication" and "Department Head". The "Human Resources" grade is also well represented.

![Bar chart showing employee distribution by job grade](screenshots/job_grade_distribution.png)

### 4) Contract Type Distribution

Pie chart showing the distribution of contract types among employees.

The figure illustrates that **fixed-term contracts (CDD)** are the most common, followed closely by **vocational integration contracts (CIVP)**, and then by **permanent contracts (CDI)**.

### 5) Relationship Between Overtime Hours and Job Grades

Bar chart illustrating the relationship between overtime hours and job grades.

This analysis highlights a correlation between employeesâ€™ job grades and the number of overtime hours worked. Directors tend to work the most overtime hours, while the Human Resources department records the fewest overtime hours, suggesting differences in workload and time management across different job grades.

### 6) Correlation Matrix Between Dataset Variables

This graph represents a heatmap of the correlation matrix between the various variables of the data frame. The numerical values indicated in each cell represent the correlation coefficient between pairs of variables. Darker colors indicate a stronger correlation, while lighter colors indicate a weaker correlation. This allows for a quick visualization of linear relationships between dataset variables.

![Correlation matrix heatmap](screenshots/correlation_matrix.png)
### 7) Bar Chart Illustrating the Distribution by Difficulty of Training Courses

This bar chart represents the distribution of the difficulty levels of training courses. It can be observed that most of the courses have a **"BEGINNER"** difficulty level, followed by **"ADVANCED"** and **"INTERMEDIATE"** levels. **"Conversant"** level courses are also present, although less frequently. Finally, the **"Not calibrated"** level is the least represented in our data.
